        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem Description:\n",
        "\n",
        "Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, is a well-liked pre-training technique for problems involving natural language processing that has produced noteworthy results lately. Although BERT has proved successful in a variety of NLP activities, there are a number of restrictions that may limit how well it performs in some NLP tasks. These drawbacks include a fixed-length attention mechanism, a lack of attentional specificity, a failure to explicitly model relationships between various input modalities, and a high number of parameters that make it computationally expensive to train and use in environments with limited resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Context of the Problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "The desire for natural language processing models that can efficiently and accurately carry out a variety of language-related tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question-answering, and language translation, is driving the challenge with BERT. BERT was developed as a pre-training technique for problems involving natural language processing, and it has produced outstanding performance on numerous benchmarks. Nevertheless, despite its success, BERT has drawbacks that may reduce its efficiency in some situations. The drawbacks include a fixed-length attention mechanism, a lack of attentional specificity, a failure to explicitly model relationships between various input modalities, and a high number of parameters that make it computationally expensive to train and use in environments with limited resources. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Limitation About other Approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "The following succinctly describes the BERT approach's shortcomings in natural language processing:\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Limited attention span: Because BERT's attention mechanism can only focus on a certain number of tokens in the input sequence, it can be difficult to detect long-range dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Lack of specificity: BERT's attention mechanism does not explicitly distinguish between various aspects of the input, such as the subject and object in a sentence or the sentiment and content of a text, which can restrict its capacity to capture fine-grained information that is crucial for some tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Inability to model relationships between different modalities: BERT lacks the capacity to explicitly represent relationships between various input modalities, such as text and images, which makes it difficult for the model to tackle tasks that call for a knowledge of links between various modalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Computationally expensive: Costly to train and deploy: BERT is a complex model with numerous parameters, making it costly to do so, especially in contexts with limited resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Limited transferability: Although BERT has performed well in many NLP tasks, it may not translate well to tasks that are unrelated to its pre-training goals, necessitating further fine-tuning or retraining on task-specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "A cutting-edge natural language processing model called DEBERTA (Decoding-Enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention) was released by Microsoft Research in 2020. It is a development of the well-known BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which has achieved outstanding outcomes in a variety of NLP tasks. To boost BERT's performance, DEBERTA combines a number of cutting-edge characteristics, such as disentangled attention and enhanced decoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model may selectively pay attention to various parts of the input using the new method of disentangled attention, such as the subject and object of a sentence or the sentiment and content of a document. This makes it possible for the model to gather more precise data and enhances its capacity to manage challenging natural language understanding jobs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another significant element of DEBERTA is enhanced decoding, which includes building more layers into the model to help it manage long-range dependencies in the input. In tasks like language generation and text completion, this enables the model to provide output that is more accurate and coherent.\n",
        "\n",
        "DEBERTA has outperformed the original BERT model in many ways and has produced cutting-edge outcomes on a variety of NLP tasks, including text categorization, question answering, and natural language inference."

        "# Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "By adding a disentangled attention mechanism, which enables the model to better capture long-range relationships and fine-grained information in the input, the DeBERTa model enhances the original BERT technique. In particular, the DeBERTa model substitutes a two-stage attention process for the conventional multi-head attention mechanism utilised in BERT.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each input token, the model calculates a collection of key and value vectors. The semantic characteristics of these vectors, such as the part of speech or the sentiment of the token, are then used to divide them into several groups. For each token, the model computes a set of query vectors in the second stage. Based on the groups of key and value vectors' semantic features, the model then employs a disentangled attention mechanism to focus on the relevant groups of vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The DeBERTa model is able to attend to certain components of the input more explicitly and collect fine-grained information, which may be crucial for some NLP tasks, by detaching the attention mechanism in this way. A mask-predicting training objective and a task-specific adaptor layer are two more improvements the model makes that further boost its performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The DeBERTa model performs at the cutting edge on many of these tasks when trained and tested on benchmark datasets like GLUE, SuperGLUE, and SQuAD."

        "\n",
        "DeBERTa's future development is likely to be directed on enhancing its performance on a variety of NLP tasks, including those that call for greater contextual knowledge and deductive reasoning skills. Here are some potential directions for DeBERTa going forward:\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Multimodal Language Understanding: To better comprehend the context of natural language, DeBERTa can be extended to handle multimodal inputs, such as text and visuals. This has a number of uses, including captioning pictures and visual question answering.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Few-Shot Learning: DeBERTa can be further enhanced to perform better on tasks requiring very sparse samples for the model to learn from. This can be accomplished by utilising strategies like transfer learning, meta-learning, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> DeBERTa can be expanded to learn from a stream of data in a perpetual learning environment, where the model must adapt to new tasks and ideas without forgetting the ones it has already learned. This can be helpful in a variety of real-world situations where the data is ever-changing.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> DeBERTa can be customised to include privacy-preserving methods like federated learning and differential privacy to safeguard user privacy and secure sensitive data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, DeBERTa's future development is probably going to be centred on enhancing its performance on a variety of NLP tasks, as well as expanding its capacity to handle multimodal inputs, few-shot learning, continuous learning, and privacy-preserving learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the the Kfold the accuracy of the DeBERTa model has increased"
